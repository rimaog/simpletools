Hello guys,here are some simple python scripts but yet quite powerful scripts.The first one "Universal Brute Force Tool"its a universal brute tool with a simple and easy gui to use i only involed the options of the login types instagram,twitter,joomla,wordpress but if u want u can add more to it,the tool is very easy to use thanks to its simple gui.
The second script is Vulnerability tool that is a combination of nikto,nmap,wpscan,skipfish.The tool also has a very simple and easy to use gui.U have two tabs.The first one Ip & Geo Location which is a host to ip grabber,it also has dns history on the script u just need to provide the api key,to basically bypass cloudflare and stuff like that.On the second tab is Vulnerability scan on it u just have to provide the host example google.com and press start scan.It automatically starts all the tools nikto wpscan nmap skipfish all of them together.Note that u cant chose only nmap or only skipfish,it automatically runs all of them by they  default parameters.

Note:I DONT GIVE 2 FUCKS WHAT U DO WITH THE TOOLS I DONT TAKE NO RESPONSIBILITY ON WHAT U DO WITH THEM,only for educational purposes only

make sure u have nikto,wpscam,nmap,skipfish installed

tools have a simple gui so u can easily use them

how to use the tools :

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get upgrade

if pip3 doesnt work write the following
